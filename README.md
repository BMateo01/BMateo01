### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently working on a back-end bootcamp course from Promineo Tech. I expect to complete my certificate in January 2023.

I just completed week 2 of the program. So far, I have learned to create repositories from the Command Prompt menu, perform simple operations using loops, conditionals and working with the different variables and data types. I feel very confident about this class, and I firmly believe it will give me a good Java foundation.

My background is in Finance with some management. I have a passion for numbers, which attracts me to Java.
